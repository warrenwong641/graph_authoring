# Multiagent inference system for story generation

 Generating a story with more than 10,000 words is always a struggle for LLMs because they 
 don’t have that much context length and aren’t trained to generate novel-like text. To address 
 the issues, we come up with a story generation system with structured input and agentic work 
 f
 lowto solve the issues. This project
 introduces an agent llm inference system to enable llm to analyze the story generated and all 
 the input settings from users.
